# IronRDP FFI

[Diplomat]-based FFI for IronRDP.

Currently, only the .NET target is officially supported.

## How to build

- Install required tools: `cargo xtask ffi install`
  - For .NET, note that `dotnet` is also a requirement that you will need to install on your own.

- Build the shared library: `cargo xtask ffi build` (alternatively, in release mode: `cargo xtask ffi build --release`)

- Build the bindings: `cargo xtask ffi bindings`

At this point, you may build and run the examples for .NET:

- `dotnet run --project Devolutions.IronRdp.ConnectExample`
- `dotnet run --project Devolutions.IronRdp.AvaloniaExample`

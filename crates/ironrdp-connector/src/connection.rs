///
/// **What is counted.** [MS-RDPBCGR] 3.2.5.14 gives connect-time detection
/// exactly two accumulation steps, one on the Bandwidth Measure Payload and one
/// on the 0x002B Stop, both reading "increment ... by the value specified in
/// the **payloadLength** field plus the size of the header fields (8 bytes)".
/// The section's other accumulation rule, the one that counts every byte
/// received while the window is open, belongs to the 0x0014 and 0x0114 Starts,
/// the reliable and lossy UDP variants. Connect-time is 0x1014, whose step list
/// contains no such clause, so on this path the two per-message increments are
/// the whole of the byte count.
///
/// **Which request types are in scope.** Only the 0x002B Stop, encapsulated in
/// an Auto-Detect Request PDU during the connect-time phase, is handled here.
/// [MS-RDPBCGR] 2.2.14.1.4 scopes the Auto-Detect-Request-PDU form of 0x0429 to
/// *after* the RDP Connection Sequence has completed, so it cannot legitimately
/// arrive here; its other form, and 0x0629, are tunneled over a multitransport
/// channel this step never sees. The same 2.2.14.1.4 split sets `headerLength`
/// to 0x08 for 0x002B and 0x06 otherwise, which is what fixes `AUTO_DETECT_HEADER_LEN`
/// at 8 for this path specifically.
///
/// **Windows that could not be timed.** A driver whose `received_at` is always
/// `None` never opens a window (see [`Sequence::step`]'s doc), so its Results
/// report only the Stop's own payload against the untimed floor
/// (`UNMEASURABLE_INTERVAL_MS`) rather than a full count divided by a
/// `timeDelta` nobody measured. [MS-RDPBCGR] 3.2.5.14 states the Payload
/// increment unconditionally; gating it on the window being open is a
/// deliberate SHOULD-level deviation. It under-reports rather than over-reports
/// (a server acting on 3.3.5.14 picks conservative settings for such a client),
/// so it is not treated as a spec violation worth rejecting.
///
/// **This deliberately does not match FreeRDP.** FreeRDP counts the whole PDU
/// length at the framing layer, `bandwidthMeasureByteCount += length` in
/// `libfreerdp/core/rdp.c` after `rdp_read_header`, for any window including
/// connect-time, and then adds `payloadLength` again in
/// `libfreerdp/core/autodetect.c` for the Payload and the Stop. On the
/// connect-time path that counts the payload twice and adds framing bytes the
/// spec does not ask for. The figure is an informational QoS hint and the server
/// proceeds either way, so following the spec costs no interop and is easier to
/// justify than reproducing the reference's arithmetic. (This citation names

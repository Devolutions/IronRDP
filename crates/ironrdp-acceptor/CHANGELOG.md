### <!-- 7 -->Build

- Update dependencies (#695) ([c21fa44fd6](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/c21fa44fd6f3c6a6b74788ff68e83133c1314caa))

### <!-- 4 -->Bug Fixes

- Drop unexpected PDUs during deactivation-reactivation ([63963182b5](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/63963182b5af6ad45dc638e93de4b8a0b565c7d3)) 

  The current behavior of handling unmatched PDUs in fn read_by_hint()
  isn't good enough. An unexpected PDUs may be received and fail to be
  decoded during Acceptor::step().
  
  Change the code to simply drop unexpected PDUs (as opposed to attempting
  to replay the unmatched leftover, which isn't clearly needed)

- Reattach existing channels ([c4587b537c](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/c4587b537c7c0a148e11bc365bc3df88e2c92312)) 

  I couldn't find any explicit behaviour described in the specification,
  but apparently, we must just keep the channel state as they were during
  reactivation. This fixes various state issues during client resize.

- Do not restart static channels on reactivation ([82c7c2f5b0](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/82c7c2f5b08c44b1a4f6b04c13ad24d9e2ffa371))

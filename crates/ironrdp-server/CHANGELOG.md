## [[0.4.1](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/compare/ironrdp-server-v0.4.0...ironrdp-server-v0.4.1)] - 2025-01-28

### <!-- 1 -->Features

- Advertize Bitmap::desktopResizeFlag ([a0fccf8d1a](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/a0fccf8d1a3eeab6c73ed7d9cdbb4342cca173c4)) 

  This makes freerdp keep the flag up and handle desktop
  resize/deactivation-reactivation. It should be okay to advertize,
  if the server doesn't resize anyway, I guess.

- Add volume support (#641) ([a6c36511f6](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/a6c36511f6584f67b8c6e795c34d5007ec2b24a4)) 

  Add server messages and API to support setting client volume.

### <!-- 4 -->Bug Fixes

- Drop unexpected PDUs during deactivation-reactivation ([63963182b5](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/63963182b5af6ad45dc638e93de4b8a0b565c7d3)) 

  The current behaviour of handling unmatched PDUs in fn read_by_hint()
  isn't good enough. An unexpected PDUs may be received and fail to be
  decoded during Acceptor::step().
  
  Change the code to simply drop unexpected PDUs (as opposed to attempting
  to replay the unmatched leftover, which isn't clearly needed)

- Reattach existing channels ([c4587b537c](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/c4587b537c7c0a148e11bc365bc3df88e2c92312)) 

  I couldn't find any explicit behaviour described in the specification,
  but apparently, we must just keep the channel state as they were during
  reactivation. This fixes various state issues during client resize.

- Do not restart static channels on reactivation ([82c7c2f5b0](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/82c7c2f5b08c44b1a4f6b04c13ad24d9e2ffa371)) 

- Check client size ([0f9877ad39](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/0f9877ad3901b37f58406095e05f345fbc8a5eaa)) 

  It's problematic when the client didn't resize, as we send bitmap
  updates that don't fit. The client will likely drop the connection.
  Let's have a warning for this case in the server.

### <!-- 6 -->Documentation

- Use CDN URLs instead of the blob storage URLs for Devolutions logo (#631) ([dd249909a8](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/dd249909a894004d4f728d30b3a4aa77a0f8193b)) 



## [[0.4.0](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/compare/ironrdp-server-v0.3.1...ironrdp-server-v0.4.0)] - 2024-12-17

### <!-- 1 -->Features

- [**breaking**] Make TlsIdentityCtx accept PEM files ([#623](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/pull/623)) ([9198284263](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/9198284263e11706fed76310f796200b75111126)) 

  This is in general more convenient than DER files.

  This patch also includes a breaking change in the public API. 
  The `cert` field in the `TlsIdentityCtx` struct is replaced by a `certs` field containing multiple `CertificateDer` items.

## [[0.3.1](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/compare/ironrdp-server-v0.3.0...ironrdp-server-v0.3.1)] - 2024-12-14

### Other

- Symlinks to license files in packages ([#604](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/pull/604)) ([6c2de344c2](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/6c2de344c2dd93ce9621834e0497ed7c3bfaf91a))

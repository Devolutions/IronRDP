### <!-- 1 -->Features

- [**breaking**] Make TlsIdentityCtx accept PEM files ([#623](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/pull/623)) ([9198284263](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/9198284263e11706fed76310f796200b75111126)) 

  This is in general more convenient than DER files.

  This patch also includes a breaking change in the public API. 
  The `cert` field in the `TlsIdentityCtx` struct is replaced by a `certs` field containing multiple `CertificateDer` items.

# Iron Remote Desktop â€” Helper Crate

Helper crate for building WASM modules compatible with the `iron-remote-desktop` WebComponent.

Implement the `RemoteDesktopApi` trait on a Rust type, and call the `make_bridge!` on
it to generate the WASM API that is expected by `iron-remote-desktop`.

See the `ironrdp-web` crate in the repository to see how it is used in practice.

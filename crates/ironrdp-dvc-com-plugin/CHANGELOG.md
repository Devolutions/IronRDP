## [[0.1.4](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/compare/ironrdp-dvc-com-plugin-v0.1.3...ironrdp-dvc-com-plugin-v0.1.4)] - 2026-10-23

### <!-- 1 -->Features

- Add native MS-RDPEWA WebAuthn redirection ([#1644](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/issues/1644)) ([66da78bc4e](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/66da78bc4e6b37a7780dbf9f333234be63d96afb)) 

  Implement the RDPEWA dynamic channel with a Windows WebAuthn backend and
  wire RedirectWebAuthn for ActiveX, the optional client feature, and the
  viewer CLI.
  
  Prefer System32\webauthn.dll via the DVC COM plugin for MSTSC parity.
  The pure-Rust backend forwards ceremonies through a webauthn.dll IWTS
  oneshot so hash-only hosts that omit clientDataJSON still work; public
  WebAuthN* remains a fallback when JSON is present. Recreate
  WebAuthN_Channel opens through shared COM/listener factories because
  Windows opens and closes the channel around each RPC.
  
  Side effects:
  - New crates ironrdp-rdpewa and ironrdp-rdpewa-native
  - Config key redirectwebauthn; ActiveX ExtendedSettings property
  - ironrdp-daemon webauthn feature for ironrdp-agent
  - IRONRDP_WEBAUTHN_FORCE_NATIVE debug switch
  - Viewer --webauthn/--no-webauthn flags; .rdp redirectwebauthn default
  - ActiveX docs note no AdvancedSettings slot and no IPersist persistence

### <!-- 4 -->Bug Fixes

- Key auto-detect optional fields off requestType, not the Option ([#1491](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/issues/1491)) ([f9cc62fa2c](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/f9cc62fa2ccb4f211838dd0961c19cdf3b79a38e)) 

  ## Summary
  
  MS-RDPBCGR decides which optional fields an auto-detect message carries
  by its `requestType`. Two of these message types encoded them by
  inspecting which `Option`s happened to be set instead, so the encoder
  and the decoder disagreed about the wire.
  
  This started as a fix for `BandwidthMeasureStop` alone. Review found the
  connect-time fallback was still non-compliant, and checking whether the
  same shape appeared elsewhere in the file turned up
  `NetworkCharacteristicsResult` with the identical defect and a worse
  consequence, so both are fixed here rather than one now and one later.
  
  ## The two failure modes
  
  **Connect-time stop with no payload: encodes to bytes the decoder
  rejects.**
  
  ```rust
  AutoDetectRequest::BandwidthMeasureStop {
      sequence_number: 7,
      request_type: BW_STOP_CONNECT_TIME,
      payload: None,
  }
  ```
  
  encodes to ten bytes with `headerLength` 0x06 and no length field.
  Decoding those bytes
  fails with `not enough bytes provided to decode: received 0 bytes,
  expected 2 bytes`,
  because the decoder reads `payloadLength` back for every
  `BW_STOP_CONNECT_TIME`.
  
  **UDP stop with a payload: silently loses it.**
  
  ```rust
  AutoDetectRequest::BandwidthMeasureStop {
      sequence_number: 3,
      request_type: BW_STOP_RELIABLE_UDP,
      payload: Some(vec![0xAA; 16]),
  }
  ```
  
  encodes the length and the sixteen bytes, which the decoder never reads
  back for
  `BW_STOP_RELIABLE_UDP` or `BW_STOP_LOSSY_UDP`.
  `AutoDetectReqPdu::decode` does not check
  for trailing bytes, so the payload is dropped in transit without an
  error rather than
  refused.
  
  The second is the worse of the two: a round trip that loses data and
  reports success.
  
  ## Network Characteristics Result (2.2.14.1.5)
  
  The same defect, found by sweeping the file rather than reported.
  
  `0x0840` carries baseRTT and averageRTT, `0x0880` carries bandwidth and
  averageRTT, `0x08C0` carries all three, and the decoder already read
  them on that basis. Encoding from the `Option`s meant:
  
  - a `0x0840` result with no `base_rtt_ms` wrote a body the decoder
  cannot read;
  - a `0x0840` result carrying `bandwidth_kbps` instead wrote that
  bandwidth into the slot the decoder reads as baseRTT, so the value came
  back **silently corrupted** rather than rejected;
  - `headerLength` was always derived from `requestType`, so it could
  contradict the body it described.
  
  Encode and `size()` now consult `requestType` through a shared helper, a
  value the type does not carry is dropped rather than written, and a
  missing one that the type requires is an error.
  
  ## Fix
  
  `Encode` and `size()` now key off `requestType`, matching the decoder.
  That makes the
  wire form canonical:
  
  - an absent payload on a connect-time stop encodes as a zero length and
  reads back as an
    empty one;
  - a payload on a UDP stop never reaches the wire.
  
  Decoding and re-encoding reproduces the same bytes in every case. The
  types can still
  express states the protocol cannot, so value-level identity is not
  achievable, but byte
  stability is, and that is what a decoder consuming real traffic depends
  on.
  
  No public signatures change; this is a behaviour fix inside the existing
  `Encode` impl.
  
  ## Tests
  
  New `pdu/autodetect.rs` in `ironrdp-testsuite-core`:
  
  - a connect-time stop with no payload round-trips, and `size()` agrees
  with `encode()`;
  - a UDP stop carrying a payload encodes header-only and comes back with
  `payload: None`,
    for both the reliable and lossy request types;
  - a connect-time stop preserves a real payload;
  - decode-then-encode reproduces identical bytes for both shapes.
  
  Three of the four fail against the current encoder and pass with the
  fix. The fourth is
  a control that passed before and after.
  
  Note the existing `pdu_round_trip` fuzz oracle would not have caught
  this even with
  auto-detect added to it, since it discards the result of the re-decode
  (`let _ =`). That
  is deliberate in the oracle's design and out of scope here, but it is
  why this went
  unnoticed.
  
  ## How this was found
  
  Writing a test for the connect-time bandwidth measurement in #1465,
  which needs to answer
  a connect-time stop. The `None` case was constructed to check the reply
  path stayed
  lenient and turned out not to be constructible on the wire at all.

## [[0.1.3](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/compare/ironrdp-dvc-com-plugin-v0.1.2...ironrdp-dvc-com-plugin-v0.1.3)] - 2026-07-10

### <!-- 4 -->Bug Fixes

- Lower verbosity of routine logs in library crates ([c36032f91b](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/c36032f91b27390a2cd34bfb300cfbe099d847a9)) 

  Library crates should not emit info! for routine, repeating operations;
  that floods the default logs of the final consumer, which owns the
  verbosity decision. Reserve info! for rare connection/session lifecycle
  milestones, debug! for significant one-off events, and trace! for the
  fine-grained detail only needed when nothing else explains a problem.

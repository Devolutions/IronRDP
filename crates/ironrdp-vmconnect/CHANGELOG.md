## [[0.1.0](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/releases/tag/ironrdp-vmconnect-v0.1.0)] - 2026-08-09

### <!-- 1 -->Features

- Hyper-V vmconnect support ([#1503](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/issues/1503)) ([a7cc067d50](https://github.com/Devolutions/IronRDP/commit/a7cc067d5069cbbcb13bae3e0561c0611da3bcf6)) 

  Adds Hyper-V VMConnect's direct ordering: PCB → TLS → CredSSP → X.224.
  
  Enhanced Session is the default (`GUID;EnhancedMode=1`), with
  `--vmconnect-basic` for the synthetic console. Kept this separate in
  `ironrdp-vmconnect`; no SPN changes.
  
  Tested against the nested Hyper-V lab:
  - Enhanced: `HYBRID_EX`, rendered 1280×720
  - Basic: `HYBRID`, rendered 1280×720
  - `cargo xtask check fmt/lints/tests -v`

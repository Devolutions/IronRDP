# IronRDP Web Client

IronRDP also supports the web browser as a first class target.

See the [iron-remote-desktop-rdp](./iron-remote-desktop-rdp) for the reusable Web Component, and [iron-svelte-client](./iron-svelte-client) for a demonstration.

Note that the demonstration client is not intended to be used in production as-is.
